# Day and Trail MT5 Expert Advisor

This expert advisor, named 'Day and Trail MT5', is designed to capitalize on daily market breakouts and generate profits by implementing a trailing stop function. It tracks daily market movements and identifies breakouts based on a user-defined daily volatility threshold. When a breakout occurs, it generates an entry signal and opens a trade. The take profit level is set at a user-defined multiplier of the daily volatility, while the trailing stop level is set at a user-defined percentage.

## Input Parameters

The following input parameters can be adjusted by the user:

- `DailyVolatility`: Specifies the daily volatility threshold. The default value is 0.005.
- `TakeProfitMultiplier`: Specifies the take profit multiplier. The default value is 2.0.
- `TrailingStop`: Specifies the trailing stop percentage. The default value is 0.002.

## How it Works

The expert advisor operates as follows:

1. During initialization, the trailing stop level is calculated based on the user-defined trailing stop percentage.
2. On each tick, the expert advisor tracks the daily high and low prices, as well as the current high and low prices.
3. It checks if there is a breakout by comparing the current high with the daily high plus the daily volatility threshold, or the current low with the daily low minus the daily volatility threshold.
4. If a breakout occurs and there is no existing trade, an entry signal is generated and a trade is opened at the current market price. The take profit level is set at the entry price plus the take profit multiplier multiplied by the daily volatility.
5. If there is an existing trade, the expert advisor checks if the take profit level has been reached. If so, the trade is closed at the take profit level.
6. If the take profit level has not been reached, the trailing stop level is calculated based on the entry price and the trailing stop percentage. If the current bid price reaches or falls below the trailing stop level, the trade is closed at the trailing stop level.
7. The trailing stop level is updated as the price moves.
8. The expert advisor also provides a platform for comprehensive market analysis and the implementation of other trading functions and strategies.
